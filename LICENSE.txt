TL:DR; The product is FREE as in Beer, not in speech. You can do whatever you want with the code, you can make extensions and you can sell it as part of a website for a client. You cannot resell it as stock, or as-is. You cannot build a SaaS, that you charge for, utilizing this. Bottom line: Do what you want, and if you redistribute it in any way, it must be a component of something larger.
